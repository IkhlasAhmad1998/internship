i just completed summarizing on English document named: *TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AGREEMENT* , while all 4 models perform reasonably well but here is my opinion based on the generated summary:
*deepseek* : good but changed some terms (also missed some little details) sometime changes the original terms.
*gemini* : much better, use of original terms, but if a para contains similar context then shortening too much, follows the document flow and its headings.
*qwen* : generates summary in its own flow not acc to the document flow. providing a little more detail. but changing the headings
*gemma* : summarizing multiple headings in a single para. changing of original headings/terms.
the document i provided has tokens well under every models input token limit. so all the text provided at once to each model and generated the summary of 2048 tokens from each model.


claude: good summary, headings are good, but using gui cant asses its performance as cant generate more tokens so looses most of the context

gpt: best
